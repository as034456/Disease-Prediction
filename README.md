In this project we learn to use the different libraries of the python programming language for 
data cleaning and refining process. Besides the refining, we implement the lemmatization
 and vectorization for basic and advanced words of English Language which in simple
 terms, prepares the machine to interpret the human spoken language in numerical form.
 The use of classifiers such as the Naive Bayes and the Passive Aggressive were designed to
 function in a way that could now read the native human language and predict the result
 required. This project aims to teach a machine to predict diseases with satisfactory degree
 of accuracy.
